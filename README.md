# 🚀 Anglomova: A Solo Dev's Quest to Fix English Learning

Hey! I'm the English teacher and developer behind [Anglomova.com](https://anglomova.com). I’m also an English teacher, and I built this platform because I was tired of "robotic" language apps that lack soul.

This repo is a collection of my personal frameworks, learning tips, and the architectural philosophy behind the app.

## 👋 Meet Anya AI

The heart of Anglomova is **Anya**. She’s not just a wrapper for a chatbot. I’ve designed her to have a **gorgeous personality**—she’s witty, perceptive, and understands the "vibe" of a conversation. 

Anya is an AI tutor you actually *want* to talk to, helping you move past the "intermediate plateau" through genuine connection and grammar drills.

## 📂 Folders & Resources

I've organized this repo to be direct and "spot-on":

* **/tips** – High-impact strategies for vocabulary, speaking, and "thinking" in English.
* **/app-guides** – How to use the Anglomova architecture to speed up your progress.
* **/roadmap** – My personal curriculum from A1 to C1 levels.
* **/philosophy** – Why I believe personality-driven AI is the future of education.

## 🛠 Built by a Solo Dev

Anglomova is a labor of love. As both the architect and the teacher, I’m building this in public. This repo serves as:
1. A resource for my students.
2. A transparent look at how I’m building a personality-driven learning engine.
3. An SEO hub to help more people find a better way to learn.

## 🤝 Want to help?

Since I'm a solo dev, I welcome any feedback, stars ⭐, or pull requests! Whether it's a new learning "hack" or a bug report, your input helps me make Anya even better.
