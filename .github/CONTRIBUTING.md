# 🤝 The Contributor’s Protocol: A Gentleman’s Agreement

Welcome to the Anglomova architecture. 

This is a solo-driven startup, built with the discipline of the old world and the technology of the new. While I, the Architect, maintain the core engine, I recognize that true flourishing often comes from the collective intelligence of high-rank individuals.

If you wish to contribute to the mission of creating a more respectful and successful English-speaking world, please observe the following protocols.

### 🏛️ The Standard of Excellence
Before you submit an issue or a pull request, ask yourself: *Does this add value, or is it merely noise?* We do not entertain "clown-tier" suggestions or 5-second attention span critiques. We build for the long term.

### 🛠️ Fields of Contribution

#### 1. Technical Bug Reports
If you detect a glitch in the engine—be it a logic error in the grammar banks or a CSS misalignment in the mobile UI—document it with precision. Provide steps to reproduce, expected results, and your environment. 
*A gentleman is precise; a clown is vague.*

#### 2. Pedagogical Enhancements
The `/tips` folder is the repository of our collective wisdom. If you have a sophisticated strategy for mastering nuance, phrasal verbs, or "vibe-checks" in professional English, your insights are welcome. 

#### 3. Anya’s Voice
If you find a way to make Anya’s feminine flair even more witty or her explanations more humanized, submit your draft. We strive for a personality that is gorgeous, not robotic.

### 📜 The Protocol for Pull Requests
1. **Fork with Purpose:** Do not fork just to have a trophy on your profile.
2. **Commit with Clarity:** Your commit messages should be structured. 
   * *Example: `feat: add high-rank idiom guide for boardroom success`*
3. **Respect the Vision:** Contributions that attempt to "dumb down" the app or introduce mindless gamification will be rejected without debate.

### 🍷 Final Note
If your contribution is merged, you aren't just a "user"—you are part of the Anglomova legacy. You are helping build a tool that turns learners into respected personalities.

**Stay disciplined. Stay focused.**
