# 🏗️ Product Blueprint: The Anglomova Engine

Anglomova isn't a prototype; it’s an operational ecosystem. This blueprint tracks the "Build" as it stands today and where the signal goes next.

### ✅ System Status: Operational (The Foundation)

The core infrastructure is live and battle-tested. I've focused on building a "mobile-PC friendly" environment that works wherever you are.

* **Curriculum Deployment:** * **A1 to B2:** 100% Uploaded and optimized.
    * **C1 Mastery:** 50% Complete (It's a massive, brutal beast, currently being refined).
* **The Banks (Vocab & Grammar):** High-efficiency data banks that function with "Duolingo-style" gamification but are fully integrated into the Anya ecosystem.
* **The AI Layer (Anya):**
    * **Voice/Text Feedback:** Active. Pronunciation and vibe checks are live.
    * **Humanized Explanations:** Deep logic for grammar queries is functional.
* **UX/UI Assets:** Upgraded task interfaces and imagery. Designed for an engaging, "underground" vibe that doesn't feel like a boring classroom.
* **The Feedback Loop:** Summary pages, performance tracking, and achievement systems are fully wired to provide relevant results upon completion.
* **Commerce:** Purchasing and subscription infrastructure is 100% stable.

### ⚡ Incoming Updates: The Future Sprint

The machine is never finished. Here is what is currently on the workbench:

1.  **Writing Checks:** Specialized AI modules to critique and refine written English for nuance and professional polish.
2.  **Real-Time Dialogues:** Low-latency, live verbal sparring with Anya. The ultimate goal.
3.  **Detailed Linguistic Debugging:** Advanced mistake tracking that shows you exactly where your "code" (English) is breaking over time.
4.  **Final C1 Push:** Completing the massive C1 curriculum to ensure even the most advanced learners have a mountain to climb.

### 🏁 Support the Vision
Building a solo startup at this scale requires two things: precision and support. If you appreciate the architecture, **upgrade to a Premium plan.** It powers the servers and funds the next generation of Anya’s evolution.
